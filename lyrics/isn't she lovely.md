**Isn't She Lovely**

Isn't she lovely?<br>
Isn't she wonderful?<br>
Isn't she precious?<br>
Less than one minute old<br>
I never thought through love, we'd be<br>
Making one as lovely as she<br>
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Isn't she pretty?<br>
Truly the angel's best<br>
Boy, I'm so happy<br>
We have been heaven blessed<br>
I can't believe what God has done<br>
Through us, He's given life to one<br>
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Isn't she lovely?<br>
Life and love are the same<br>
Life is Aisha<br>
The meaning of her name<br>
Londie, it could have not been done<br>
Without you who conceived the one<br>
That's so very lovely, made from love
