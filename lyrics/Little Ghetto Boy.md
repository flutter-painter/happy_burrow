# Little Ghetto Boy (Donny Hathaway)

Little ghetto boy, playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha' gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?
Will you spend your days and nights in a pool room?
Will you sell caps of madness to the neighborhood?
Little ghetto boy
You already know how rough life can be
'Cause you've seen so much pain and misery
Little ghetto boy
Your daddy was blown away
He robbed that grocery store
Don't you know that was a sad, sad old day?
All of your young life you've seen such misery and pain
The world is a cruel place
And it ain't gonna change
You're so young and you've got so far to go
But I don't think you'll reach your goal, young man
Hangin' by the pool room door
Look out, son
Little ghetto boy
When, when, when you become a man
You can make things change, hey hey
If you just take a stand
You gotta believe it yourself in all you do
You've got to fight to make it better
You'll see how other people will start believing, too
Then, my son, things will start to get better
Everything has got to get better (I declare, I believe that today)
Everything has got to get better
Everything has got to get better (just as soon as you make up your mind)
Everything has got to get better (you go 'head on and do what's right)
Everything has got to get better (I said everything has got to get better)
Everything has got to get better (I'm depending on you, little brother)
Everything has got to get better (I'm depending on you)
Everything has got to get better (Hey hey, need your help, little brother)
Everything has got to get better
