# so they say (Patrick Paige II)

I don't know if I'm doing this in vein
But I swear that this shit be in my veins
This shit starting to drive me insane
I just want the money I don't even need the fame
What if the shit I'm making actually lame?

And thats why I ain't took off like a bullet train?
What if I ain't as good as I think I am ?
All this gold on my neck like who do I think I am ?

Complex wiring and circuitry gave me emotions,
Connected to my brain from which that came all the notions,
I'd be a liar if I said I didn't fill my mind with doubt,
I'd be a liar if I didn't get my truth out,
Now I done rapped my heart out and blew the booth out
And I done rapped so hard I swear I spit a tooth out
The hour glass ain't giving me no time back
Talk to my nana with her cigarettes and wine glass (and she said)

Everything happens for a reason, so they say
But honestly I don't know what to believe in these days
Seasons change, people change,
Talked to my niggas and they told me don't trip,
Cause you're the captain of your own ship

My girl been going through it sometimes I feel helpless
Brainstorm with my friends like damn, how can I help this?
I just be wealthy, buy shit I couldn't afford
I still live within my means I drive a honda accord
I take 87 gas, I'm not a regular nigga
Support black business breaking bread with all my niggas
I ain't got stop till I pile several figures
Retire when I'm tired go figure

Everything happens for a reason, so they say
But honestly I don't know what to believe in these days

Starring in the dark my thoughts haunting me all at night
I done been so broke I done put my pockets in rice
I don't keep a stank face I try to keep it polite
Speeding down that tunnel towards the light

Everything happens for a reason, so they say
But honestly I don't know what to believe in these days
Seasons change, people change,
Talked to my niggas and they told me don't trip,
Cause you're the captain of your own ship
