# O Holy Night

Arrangement by Michael Guy Chislett & Dylan Thomas

VERSE 1
O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviourâ€™s birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn

CHORUS 1
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born

VERSE 2
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains He shall break
For the slave is our brother
And in His Name
All oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy
In grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy Name

CHORUS 2
Christ is the Lord
O praise His Name forever
His power and glory
Evermore proclaim
His power and glory
Evermore proclaim

CHORUS 3
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine
